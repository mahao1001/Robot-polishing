Robot Polishing Adaptive Force-Position-Speed Collaborative Process Planning

This study focuses on polishing curved workpieces with a robotic manipulator. Core methods involve robotic manipulator control, polishing removal material modeling, and curvature-adaptive trajectory generation.

File "polishing_curver" shows Curvature adaptive trajectory;
File "error" shows Orientation_error and Position_error;
File "SI" shows Intelligent Swarm Algorithm/Heuristic Algorithm. In this study, the Dung Beetle Optimizer (DBO) and Antlion Optimization Algorithm (ALO), Gray Wolf Optimization Algorithm (GWO), Sparrow Search Algorithm (SSA), and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) were used for the solution. 
File "Roughness" shows polishing_Roughness compared with original algorithm.
